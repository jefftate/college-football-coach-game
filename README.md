# college-football-coach-game
A college football coach simulation game built with Java (currently runs in console).

Play as the head coach of a college football team over the course of a career. Make high level decisions about recruiting and training your team. Features include game outcomes based on probability, a top 25 ranking system, random events, bowl games, and career statistics.

The current version of the game runs in the console. The opponents a player faces each season are listed in teamlist.txt. The team name and strength of each opponent can be modified via this file (must have 12 teams in the file). Team strength can range from 0 - 400, with 200 being an average strength team. A team with a strength above 300 is a potential national champion and a team below 100 strength is a very weak team.
